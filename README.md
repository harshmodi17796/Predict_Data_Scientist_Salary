# Data Scientist Salary Prediction

### Welcome to this project.

#### In this project, I am trying to predict salary of Data Scientist in various regions. During this project, I have learned various parts of Data Science project, such as, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Model Building and Model Evaluation. It is a challenging project, because the dataset has been generated using web scraping with help of Selenium Library.

#### I have followed Mr. Ken Jee, a famous Youtuber. One can find his project here: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj

#### The dataset: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj/blob/master/glassdoor_jobs.csv

#### The difference between mentor’s project and my project is the explanation of each step, which I have understood, while going through his project and video. The detailed explanation behind the necessary steps has helped me to enhance my knowledge. I hope, you will also get some good things while going through my project.

#### The Project file has been saved as ‘Predict_Data_Scientist_Salary.ipynb’.

#### Thank You…See you in the project…
